No matter what, make a Time Machine Backup before upgrading. I (and contributors) will not be liable if something goes wrong. I will go to the best of my abilities to help if there is a problem, but I don't know everything and there are some cases where I cannot help. A lot of times, it isn't even Patched Sur's fault, so there's nothing I can do.";
